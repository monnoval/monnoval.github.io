Vim is damn tough to learn. There's __No Single Living Man In The World__ that uses all the features of vim. Vim users only use what they needed on their day to day text editor needs.

When I was at school switching from both Windows and Arch Linux while working on my final project. Choosing Vim have its own love and hate.

<br/>

## Vim is portable

♥ It is installed by default on almost all Linux distribution, maybe not vim itself but its parent vi, but not to worry they're close friends, if you know one, you'll know both.

✖ Well in reality who does use multiple Linux distributions at one time? Almost all text editor now are portable or even cross platform. You have [atom](http://atom.io), [brackets](http://brackets.io) and [notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org).

<br/>

## Vim is fast

♥ It is a text editor with very depth customization that can level up to an IDE.

✖ Okay, maybe Vim is one of the fastest text editor but Notepad, Notepad++ and Textmate are really good for day to day use, and customization with them is possible to some extent.

<br/>

## Vim key-bindings

♥ Switching from normal and insert mode is confusing at start but it does make sense when you'll get used to it. It does let you learn how to [touch-type](http://monnoval.github.io/2014/03/17/how-important-is-touch-typing-to-a-programmer) in a way which I'm a big fan of it.

✖ Learning vim's key-bindings have a really, really high learning curve. Anyone would experience awkward typing habits in the first 1-2 years of using it. I did regret I chose Vim as an editor while rushing my final school project. Don't get me wrong I'm quite happy now but the first time using it was horrible.

<br/>

## Vim on GUI or on terminal

♥ Back then I was working on both Windows and Arch Linux, GVim or VIM settings for different operating systems is slightly different. Every little tiny configuration should be taken care for a fun loving editing experience.

✖ It's a waste of time setting up which setting is for what platform. Rather than doing actual work, you'll be spending time configuring your editor just to sooth 1% of your needs.

<br/>

## Vimrc

♥ Vim is one of the best text editors created. You can just install plugins and set them the way you needed them. You can create functions or even features on the fly. It is easy for me now after some time knowing the ins and outs of vim.

✖ Updating vimrc takes tremendous amount of time. Crazy a lot of time. I just recently [threw my old vimrc then started again from scratch](https://github.com/monnoval/dotvim). Until now I'm not done yet.

## Why I'm not done updating my vimrc?

♥ Learning Vim is a lifetime experience.
