Daily scrum is a subset of scrum. Basically daily scrum is a stand-up meeting done by team members daily. It has a couple of guidelines to assure the team can benefit from the information provided by each team member. Daily scrum is effective and beneficial for the whole team but it is also a tool to mess up a team.

<!--more-->

A team is composed of members, without the members there will be no team. If one member is screwed so does the whole team. Logic is damn simple, to mess a team screw a team member.

Well there are a lot of ways to put down a team member. Before going with the details. Let's give birth to Danny. Danny is a fictional character for this post only and he has been a software engineer with 3 years experience. He is a intelligent, and hard-working guy. Nuff said.

Why would we want to screw Danny? Well we can just throw a knife while he's stirring his morning coffee, lucky if it'll stick right in the skull and die. But if the knife will bounce? Your going to jail man or even have a death penalty, lol. So better read on and learn from this awesome screw tool: Daily Scrum.

Before I load the tips on how to mess Danny and your team. You may need to know the basics. If you already know the basic stuff, you can scroll directly to the Tip 1.

## Basics

What is Scrum? Just a brief: Scrum is a life cycle development methodology that has been widely used on both internal and external projects. Its intention is to reap benefits from fast iteration, let's say the product owner have changes, those changes would then be done in a sprint which range from 1-2 weeks. This would happen iteratively as long as the project continues.

Scrum is only a process. The scrum master, as a role, would need the team to follow the process but in reality it is not about making the team follow the process but it is more for the team to be effective and accumulate benefits from the cycle.

The process involves a stand-up meeting that would require each team member to answer three question. Let me quote Wikipedia on this:

> There are three questions to ask and answer in the daily stand-up. Though it may not be practical to limit all discussion to these three questions, the goal is to stick as closely as possible to these questions:
1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. What obstacles are impeding my progress?
â€” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting

Everyday each team member needed to be prepared before the daily scrum would start. The whole session should be time boxed to 15 minutes.

So now you should have a good understanding of scrum.
Easy right? Of course it should be! Now I'll present the meat of this post. Let's start messing up!

## Tip 1: On-time

Daily scrum should start on time and if Danny is late, it would be your chance to be upfront and put some punishment on it.

You: Hey Danny! Why your late man? We all agreed to be on time so that we can do this fast then get back to work asap but with what you've done, the team may need to stay back late. (The do the calm seriously killing face expression...)
Danny: Uhhhmm, really sorry... (Even if Danny is still talking, immediately cut him off)
You: All of us are miserably affected on what you've done.
Danny: Really sorry man this won't happen again (This is a general response and you should be negative about this so that you won't create trust with Danny - *Sooo Evil*)

Simple but trust me this works. You can actually add more value to the above so that the beef will be more firm. Show to other team members how asshole the person they're dealing with. ;)

## Tip 2: Ask details

Problems or blockages encountered by a team member in daily scrum can be highlighted but would be discussed in detail after the meeting. This would keep the daily scrum fast and quick and most likely fit in the 15 minutes duration.

So with that information in mind you can diss Danny to explain in detail the issue that he may highlight during the meeting. This won't diss Danny at first but surely this would create negative vibes on him. Do make sure to do it in a way that Danny looks bad at everyone. With Danny explaining the problem, the meeting would surely exceed 15 minutes and you can use Danny as a reason why the meeting exceeded.

I know this would sound evil enough but do it in the right way and you'll be able win. Good luck!

## Tip 3: Scrum Master

Alright we know already that Danny or any other software engineer need sometime to be a scrum master. Being a scrum master who can squeeze benefits from his team members would need to master Tai Chi.

To be specific, this is not about project management but this is more on being a leader. Leadership is about managing self first then managing people will come to play. Being a leader is to nurture inner self while management is a skill can be learned by anyone.

The difference of management and being a leader is by far enough to screw Danny. So putting Danny as scrum master would efficiently mess the daily scrum.

What if Danny will be successful in this role? Well your Danny is one in a million talent. Try this first, I can assure you 99% success rate.

## Tip 4: Win

I'll teach you how to be a creator of awkward moments. Here's how:

After daily scrum is done. You can now discuss how to resolve a problem highlighted by Danny. Make sure that Danny is not that experienced plus have not encountered solving this kind of issue.

Here is how to do it:

Always ask "So how?"... Don't talk, wait for an answer... If Danny would answer something, make that answer wrong then ask again "So how?"... Don't talk, wait for an answer... Do this repeatedly until it becomes more awkward than ever, make sure to be soooo serious until Danny will feel so miserable and will likely jump in the building.

The key thing here is to have a Win-Lose mentality. You must win and Danny should lose. Hurray!

## Tip 5: Diss more

There are a lot of ways to disrespect someone. There are a hundred ways to kill a cat. Do it in any way you wanted.

Here are some points you can do to further mess up the team:

- Be very very serious in daily scrum. Tomorrow is the end. Daily scrum will save you and the team
- Your team members owe you their life. If you're the boss, they owe you their salary. If you're part of the development team, everyone cannot continue without you.
- Favoritism is a key factor when it comes to asking questions. Ask details only on a 'Danny' or similar person participating in the team
- Push the idea of working in weekends. Yes, that is both Saturday and Sunday, full day and night. Sleep sucks so do not bother.
- Always let the team know they are always late on the deliverables even they have clocked extended hours.
- Let them be the mercenary. Let them be the hero. Because hero's die.

## Summary

The scenarios I highlighted in the tips are ways to disrespect anyone. You would think that I'm such a bad person for giving out these tips but think of it the other way: This is the best way to mess up a team with Daily Scrum.
