This book is a bridge for information technology and the financial markets. There are a lot of things to talk about and the book is extensively informative about algorithms, software, high-frequency trading (HFT), and people building extreme complex systems that run stock markets today.

When I saw this in the bookstore I first checked the reviews in Amazon, quickly skimmed and read them, which are mostly positive. Read thru the first few pages which are talking about [Sergey Aleynikov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Aleynikov) a programmer in Goldman Sachs who was allegedly stole code which maybe used to manipulate markets. How interesting is that for a start? A book that talks about a programmer in the financial markets made me think then decided to buy and continued reading in a coffee shop.

This book should have its own category in non-fiction. It tells a story in a fictional way. Still states the current facts. After the book is published FBI launched an investigation. It started debates and discussions in the current state of the markets.

Michael Lewis knows how to translate complex and confusing things into layman terms. I'm fond of the him explaining financial aspects using scenarios or examples which would surely make the readers say "Ahahhh!". Most sections in the book have this way of writing and take you everywhere the story progresses.

## Conclusion

By far the most exciting book I ever read. Seriously it is extremely hard to stop myself from turning from one page to another. This is my first time to finish a book in less than a week.

### Bonus

Alright let me give you a bonus. After I finished reading the book. I immediately searched for ["Brad Katsuyama"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Katsuyama) in Google and clicked some links until I reach watched the whole video below.

This debate happened after the book was launched. The debate was exciting and funny, two at the same time! I was laughing many times while watching the video. Brad Katsuyama really knew what he is talking about. William O'Brien on the other hand tried his best but from the looks of it he's going to nowhere.

This book is worth the penny. I would really advice anyone in the stock market to read this book. Plus I really enjoyed the experience in reading it.
