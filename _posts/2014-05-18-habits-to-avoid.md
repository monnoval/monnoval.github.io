title: Habits to Undo at Work
---

Being effective at work takes us to philosophical boundaries. There is a choice between process and chaos in achieving the end point. By experience there was no basics thought in finishing a project. There is only what we needed to implement which is already simple. Too simple to do. Too simple to forget.

When we are at work we are always busy, always rushing, always have deadlines and we always have something to do. We tend to think work itself is most important. Nothing else is much more important which is why we need to keep up and not be distracted.

By the time we are working, we forget.  
We forget to be human.  
To be human is to be effective.

Below I am listing what I experienced and would dedicate myself to undo them.

## No Lunch

For people working together, lunch is the best way to mingle and communicate with each other.

It's a time where each can talk anything they can think of. Life, stories, movies, weekends, etc. This is a time where

- optimism be widen
- ideas to be discussed
- thoughts be spoken
- matters be related
- issues be raised
- possibilities be considered

Lunch is not a time for resolving any problems. It's a time to eat and letting the stomach manage all food going in. It's the best time of the day to let both mind and body feel calm.

A culture which cultivates people to work more and neglect the basics is worth leaving. A project deadline has never been worth sacrificing versus a person's health.

Lunch is important enough as a source of energy for the next hours in the day. Energy which would make you more effective.

## No Help

We all needed help. To learn to NOT say "I need help" is completely wrong. We need it and it would be impossible to not welcome any of it.

The first time I heard it from someone. It kind of awoken my ideas at the same time I sensed a false idea. This is how it was said

> In this company there is No Help.  
> Each person needs to work with each other.

I understand the idea where people talk loudly on helping another. Such as "Sure I'll help you" but in the end you get no one helping you. I would love to think this way but this makes people not give trust to anyone interested in helping. This itself is a negative intention.

Every member in the team would then not use the word HELP for them TO HELP anyone.  
This is confusing and absurd!

Help is a need. Positive in nature. The word itself must not be given negative impression.

## Thank You?

I remember a scenario where I did help someone that has been stuck on a task for a long time. Let's name this guy _Thankie_.

After solving the issue _Thankie_ was so thankful and continued to thank me a couple of times. Yeah that's why I want to name him as _Thankie_. It was kind of crazy because he was not able to stop thanking me. Maybe its just his way of being truly thankful to anyone. After sometime of thanking me again, the boss noticed then said:

__Boss:__ _Thanks for what?_  
__Thankie:__ _Oh I was just thanking him because I was stuck of this issue for some time._  
__Boss:__ _Oh okay..._

During this time of this writing, I can still remember the time where the boss say _"Oh okay..."_. No smile, no smirk, did not look at me, just a half a second stare in the eyes of Thankie then walked away. For me, the gesture from his eyes accompanied with the whole body movement was saying:

_So what? There is nothing to thank him because it is his responsibility
to resolved any issue you may encounter._

Maybe I'm just being too skeptic, or maybe too pessimist but I am sure of myself that he was thinking the way I thought. Thinking too much? Maybe. If this kind of person is thankful on what was done then maybe he would respond in a humane way.

Humaneness is a huge factor as a leader of a team. I am not able to tolerate another inhumane treatment toward anyone.

Saying thank you is an act of kindness. We must accept it.

## Summary

Alright, just to summarise:

1. Make sure to have lunch at work.
2. Help anyone in need.
3. Say thank you whole heartedly.

Thank you very much for reading!
