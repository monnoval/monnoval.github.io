title: Why do some people create software for free?

I always felt "software for free" is in humans nature to give. Software as free is not a matter of giving then getting money later but it is really just giving. Giving without a thought of returns. Giving with a thought that people would use it somehow.

I'll quote [The Mythical Man-Month](http://www.amazon.com/The-Mythical-Man-Month-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959) Chapter 1. The Tar Pit - The Joys of the Craft

> Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the childâ€™s first pencil holder "For Daddy's office". - Frederick P. Brooks Jr. - The Mythical Man-Month

This book was first published in 1975 but until now it is still read by professionals from fields inside and outside of IT. Going back to the quote, as one of the joys of programming which is quite true to most developers. This relates with the transition of developers from SourceForge to GitHub.

The projects in Github is crazy. Immensely immeasurable how people connect and assist each other.

Software as free is just a step forward to a more open world.

- [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) as non-profit was a "No" and "Impossible" when Microsoft was doing Encarta Encyclopedia. But people from all over the world did and would still contribute information to have a better Encyclopedia for all.
- [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com) as a crowd-funding platform has always made me think that crowd-funding translated from the philosophy of open source.
- [Gittip](https://www.gittip.com), anyone can give money every week to people and teams you believe in. What? Yes, I also cannot believe this the first I knew about it.

These are few of what has been done from a very simple thing which is to give.
