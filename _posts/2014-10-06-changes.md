The previous month was crazy. I moved to another company and now I'm currently working at Fastbooking Asia. There were a lot of other work related stuff I did settle to have a smooth transition. And still now I'm catching up with all the new stuff I'm working with. I'm sure this would continue at no end.

Moving work here in Singapore has never been easy. Experiencing it twice didn't just validate it. But it prove all my expectations. Maybe foreign workers need more than just perseverance but more of acceptance. Duh!

## Portfolio

I'm also clearing up my portfolio page. Removing all the items I setup a year ago.

When I was looking at my portfolio, all seems irrelevant. Any work I did for the companies I worked with did not show what I love to do. So clearing it up does make sense.

Any work I'm gonna be putting up in my portfolio page should be done with my personal time only. With this I think it would be more relevant and creates that personal touch to it.

## Moving on again

Last year I created this website. Took time to do some blog posts. Now trying my very best to maintain this site. Now in a midst of moving again, not just in perspective of work but in career.

I hope things will get better! Boom!
