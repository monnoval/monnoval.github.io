Since the question is asking for bad things. Let me list the bad things while not forgetting about all the good things.

I'm a Filipino living here in Singapore for the past 3 years. And it's been awesome but... Yes! Let's start with the "buts"

## Expensive

__Accommodation:__ Really hard to find a cheap and assured privacy on the condo/house you may stay in. Expensive for foreigners coming from developing countries. This is why most foreigners share a condo unit up to 6-12 heads.

__Food__ is not that cheap here. Range is from S$2.5 - 5. We'll if you're working here, food should be kind of cheap but for me still expensive, native food from other countries are still far so cheap.

__Alcohol:__ I heard there is a 25% increase on all alcohol. Then 10% on cigarettes. This is crazy but yeah better moderate now.

## Stressful

I  did work in a small IT firm before. We did software and the atmosphere  was great but the pressure was crazy! Sleep was getting lesser, deadlines are weekly, no weekends of almost 2-4 weeks. But I fought on, even though my mind was set on quitting.  I stayed for another year even though I feel so demoralized. I felt so  down because daily scrum became daily scrutiny on me.

To cut the  story short, the boss decided that all employees (developers and testers) to leave because of  financial issues. I do not mean this was done explicitly to me but after I moved on to another  job, I realized that I was not treated fairly. In addition to realizing it, I also should have known that it is quite related to [Constructive dismissal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_dismissal).

I'm not saying this is in general that both a company and a boss in Singapore (or any other countries) are the worst but as a foreigner you must be prepared and  aware on how to manage these kind of issues.

## Communication

We'll there's a huge need to be understood by someone when you are talking in English. What happens if they don't? We'll here some things that may occur:

A prospective employer may not hire you if you just respond by "Yes" and "Ok" all  the time. You need to converse like what you see in movies.
You'll have hard time having friends from other nationalities. And seriously you need to have some to survive.
You'll feel shy and conversation may become awkward but please don't. Do keep the conversation going with a smile and questions that will let you understand them more.

## Other bad things

__Populated:__ Yes, it's populated now. Foreigners should go home already. Oops I'm a foreigner also, just joking.

__Complaints:__ Everybody complain, not really a bad thing but does really push things differently compared to not complaining. Maybe bad thing in a sense that I hear them mostly on my local friends.

__Serious:__ Most people when they walk they really look serious. Just imagine, they walk fast, they don't smile and and it's the end of the world.

## The Good Stuff

__Clean:__ Singapore is the cleanest country I have ever been. When I first stepped here, it was like a dream that the road is so green with all the trees.

__Food:__ All the variety of food is just worth staying here.

__Shopping:__ Almost all MRT stations have shopping malls.

__Weather:__ Similar as my home country but more humid, maybe because of the trees.

__Toilets:__ Toilets in malls are clean. Even some food centers have clean toilets. Some say it is the cleaners that made Singapore so clean.

__Transportation:__ Except for cabs, most are cheap such as the trains and buses.

__Connectivity:__ Wifi is almost everywhere.
