It has been a year of using [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HCCNJU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007HCCNJU&linkCode=as2&tag=monnoval-20&linkId=2VRWLZZ3CMMA5TBV). It is the best device for reading! The best facts I could say is: I always can reread the books I finished anytime I'm on the go. Reading articles I find in the web has never been this easy.

I always get caught in debates like kindle vs paperback. Most of the time it confuses the hell out of me. I wonder why would anyone want to carry a book at 2 inch thick. I did it for a while when I was reading [Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451648537/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1451648537&linkCode=as2&tag=monnoval-20&linkId=KZN7GHMM2TUKS3UI). It was heavy and bulky.

I'm undoubtedly towards digital by any measure. I would love everything digital especially with all the books that I own both paperback and e-book. Imagine holding a paperback where you could search for any keyword instantly. Having this kind of point of view, it is quite hard for me to justify the need for paperback. Please do not get me wrong, physical books still has its own place and I still buy from time to time. I'm even craving in getting [Bibliotheca](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/530877925/bibliotheca) from kickstarter!

## Content Consumption

I love the touch of physical books. Holding them tightly, flipping from one page to another, and that smell! Com'on a kindle cannot generate that smell on the fly!

Oh God, it smells so good!

By the time you are immensely into the universe of what you are reading. Everything changes. You are into a world where you cannot stop reading continuously. This crucial moment I'm sure you would not:

- Smell on what you are reading from, even if it does smell nice
- Realize you're reading from a very high quality paper
- Realize you're reading from a kindle, even if you really are, duh

The importance of content is higher than any decorative means. In books everybody knows content is the deciding factor for its quality. Similarly it has been taken into the web and everybody is yelling "Content is King!"

We know that Robb died but a King can never die because eventually a new King will show up!

## Convenience

The only thing that convinced me to get a Kindle is the E-Ink display. It does look like a paper and definitely an interactive paper. E-Ink itself does the job well, for me it would really be great if it had colours but I'm quite fine with black and white.

Below are the three features I find very convenient in owning a Kindle.

<br/>

### Send to Kindle

I never knew I could send web articles to kindle before having one. If I knew that I'll definitely have no doubt getting one. This thing is darn simple to use. Just install the 'Send to Kindle' extension for either Firefox or Chrome then you use it straight away.

<br/>

### 1 Click

Buying with one click is one of the most convenient thing happened to e-commerce. No need to re-enter all those addresses and credit card details, just one click and the book is ready in Kindle. Sad that only Amazon has the rights on this simple idea but nevertheless still a good thing for amazon users.

<br/>

### Kindle Cloud Reader

Recently I started to continue reading in any browser. Amazingly it also syncs the books I bought with its own notes and highlights. Simple and useful.

<br/>

## Kindle Sales

Another thing to look at is Kindle Sales. I salute Amazon for getting inside a market which they did surely won for the past years. In [December 2009, 3 Million Amazon Kindles Sold](http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/29/3-million-amazon-kindles-sold-apparently/).

As sales are increasing, bookworms worldwide are encouraged to try out Kindle, or any other Amazon devices. [Bookstores like Page One has been closing down](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/end-of-chapter-for-page-one-bookstore.html). [Borders is coming back after a huge loss](http://www.todayonline.com/business/borders-bookstore-coming-back-singapore), that is great but there is uncertainty in the market for physical books.

<br/>

## Finale thoughts

I love my Kindle and it would be hard for me to transition all my books to other device. I cannot even access my books in my iPhone, not sure why but I cannot download the Amazon Kindle app in iPhone.

Paper would not surely disappear but e-book readers like Kindle changes how we consume content.
