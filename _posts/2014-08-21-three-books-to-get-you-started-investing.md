My education in finance is zero. Gladly my parents thought me how to save money and not have debt. Well saving my money in a bank was the most basic thing to do. Still I consider my knowledge on managing my own finances zero. Even with the help of banks who makes sure my money is in-tact.

<!--more-->

Month by month I shelve money in my bank and I was really happy doing that. After months, years of doing this, I noticed something is wrong. I had a thought of doing my own business then make it grow ten fold. I know it is really ambitious and I may need to work 20 hours a day. Nahhh! Business is too cumbersome I think. Well this is how I think for now. Maybe it will change in the future.

Instead of getting myself to create __The Greatest Business Plan of All__, I took months to pause. Time came by while me and my girlfriend were waiting for our flight in the airport, we spent some time in the bookstore. There I found [My Maid Invests in the Stock Market](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9710070207/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=9710070207&linkCode=as2&tag=monnoval-20&linkId=LWP3IDDDNTJFJKNO)...and Why You Should, Too!. The book is short and I immediately finished it while in the plane. It kept me curious and kept me reading other books related to stocks.

The three books listed below made me

1. Step on the right track
2. Choose the best stocks
3. Equip the correct discipline and character

I'm not the investment advisor type of guy but trust me these books work!

## [A Beginner's Guide to Investing: How to Grow Your Money the Smart and Easy Way](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477463992/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1477463992&linkCode=as2&tag=monnoval-20&linkId=UFT5Y5M75I4VFWQY)

Understanding the words, terms and phrases they use in the stock market is the most difficult part I ever encountered. People in investment describe a simple thing differently but points to the same thing. Different terms everywhere and I would assure that it would be very hard to learn those information using the internet.

This book is the answer.

1. It is very basic, very good for beginners just like the title says
2. It gracefully introduces anyone to the world of investment
3. It is simple to read and understand

I'm still using this book as reference. Every now and then I still need to open it up and re-read things I may forget.

## [The Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing: Fifth Edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452298628/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0452298628&linkCode=as2&tag=monnoval-20&linkId=LYQERIPU7QVTDRL3)

Without this book it would be impossible to get right in choosing my first set of stocks. Immensely entertaining at the same time full of useful information from investment gurus, history, and major events. Reading this book is very easy and welcoming. Jason Kelly made this book delightful to consume.

This book works as said by Jason Kelly himself and I do believe him. I cannot imagine getting stocks without working it out in my [Stocks to Watch Worksheet](http://www.jasonkelly.com/worksheets/stocks.pdf) and [Reasons and Limits](http://www.jasonkelly.com/worksheets/R_L.pdf). And Jason does run thru all the information you need to complete the worksheet.

## [The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060555661/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060555661&linkCode=as2&tag=monnoval-20&linkId=VJDV7R2CY3FS5AGQ)

Honestly I am still half way reading but nevertheless this book is giving me the chills. It shows the history and realities of stocks, bonds, and funds.

Every chapter was written during 1972 but the commentaries for each chapter are quite recent. Basically anything written in 1972 is really hard to understand, I needed to re-read a couple of times to make sure that I understand what I'm reading. With regards to the commentaries, it could easily be understood.

To really get the juices of this book make sure you read the books above. This book is overwhelming for beginners. If you are a beginner learn the basics first then read this book.

I would surely grab another investment book soon and maybe add to this list. For now, I'm really amazed on how easy one can learn investment only by reading the books above. I never imagined I could get started immediately after learning the basics.

If you have books you highly recommend, do comment below.

Thank you for reading!
