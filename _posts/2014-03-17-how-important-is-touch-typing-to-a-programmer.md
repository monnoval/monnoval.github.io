Very important. Seriously, it's a matter of losing your ability to type. Maybe I'm kind of exaggerating but you can read-on why.

Touch-typing is not just about being productive but it is a factor to achieve comfort. This itself is a must and tightly tied to computer ergonomics. You can have the best ergonomic chair but if you type in the wrong way, it just defeats the whole purpose.

I started using a computer without any training on touch-typing. After I graduate from college I worked on improving my skill set on web development. Two years passed I did start to develop carpal tunnel syndrome on left wrist. The feeling:

After 4 hours of work my left wrist started to felt loose. Felt like it was going to pull off.
To avoid the discomfort I needed to wear a wrist support that would let my wrist to not move when I'm typing
Even when I sleep, I still wear the wrist support to make sure it won't twist or move.
The wrist support did help. I thought the main issue was the keyboard I'm using. I was using the Apple Keyboard with numpad then switched to Kinesis Freestyle2 which did lessen discomfort but it didn't really solved the main issue.

After using the Freestyle2 for a year I did switched again to Advantage Pro.  Used it for a month and then realized the main problem was my wrist/hand posture when typing. During that time, I felt I was good at touch-typing but in reality, after some research and reading, my wrist movements are actually all wrong. It took me months of practice that made all my wrist movements correct, since then the discomfort from my left wrist was getting lesser.

Now it felt like it's already gone. But I always make myself aware of my left wrist movement to assure that I'm typing the correct way.
