Opportunities itself come in various shapes. I'm confused how to assess opportunities. Is it by personal choice? Is it by presence in certain locations? Is it being in the right time?

## The past

Growing up in Philippines. At school I aspired to be a animator. Back then I love creating random moving objects. I started from simple ball bouncing using Flash. Moved to having my own flash website with all that glitters and fancy swish. I then move to using Blender for some 3D excitement. I love everything about animation! New friends came up and gave opportunities to share what I know. I was able to join events, became a speaker, shared tricks and was loving what I do. Things were getting so fun!

This was quite old but shows that we are all having fun!

The excitement within me grew like a monster but my pocket was turning into a black hole. Financially it was a lost. This was in 08-09 and I needed to take an action, I needed to find a new love that would pay back.

I started with the basics with HTML and CSS which then evolved into learning Joomla and Wordpress. I immediately grabbed some good paying projects that eventually got me going. It was fun and I was feeling the joy of compiling code fragments to create a website. Financially, things were tying together. I was happy on the puzzle solving problems that coding offers at the same time it does place a bread in my table.

Just like anyone else contentment was never possible. I was stressing out myself by working from 11pm to 9am. It was crazy. My sleep went sideways and my energy was draining month by month. Time to move on and look for alternative. I always had a thought working in outsourcing jobs could never permanent.

I went full time in teaching in my alma mater. It was fun! Teaching has always been part of me. I love sharing! Students like fun and adventurous projects also. Overall I enjoyed my time teaching! Financially it only gave a small slab of bread. I can survive with it but it is not living.

## Singapore

I could say there is huge opportunity here in Singapore especially in tech. Even though I love to encourage everyone to go look at other countries, Singapore is still one of the best. It's clean, delicious food, lots of clean toilet (nice) and good transportation. Plus tech is booming. A lot of startups. VCs are just in the corner (even though I haven't met any yet, heh).

Of course every slice of pie is only for n number of people. Struggle from the diversified tech industry is very relevant. Opportunity is huge but competition is enormous! Businesses offers higher value at lower price. Companies are looking for human resources who can deliver higher quality and produce higher quantity. Stakeholders are eager to pay high and expects to sell higher.

Developers, designers, and managers in tech were mostly expected to clock more hours. It is crazy! Estimates equals to deadlines. Outcome is assured, even though quality is being questioned outcome is still the primary concern. Just fix all the issues with hundreds of bandaids and let all the bugs die with all the strips that covered it, haha. What I'm saying here, Singapore has a culture of doing things fast. Really fast.

The system works. People are working. Resources are optimised and would still need more. Currently there is 69k of jobs available in the [Jobs Bank](https://www.jobsbank.gov.sg/).

Honestly I'm very impressed. A system where opportunities are present.  

I'm still in the midst of thinking how Singapore arrive to this level. Maybe I need to read more about economics and history.

Below are questions I'm still thinking about:

1. How come Philippines with its vast resources both human and environment is not able to give enough job opportunities?
2. Looking at Singapore, does everything need to be planned and controlled, something like playing SimCity?
3. Hmm, opportunity felt general and is for all, then on personal level is it only luck?

If you can share what you think be sure to comment below! Thanks!
