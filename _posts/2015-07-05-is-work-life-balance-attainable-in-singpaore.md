Yes but...

Just a bit of my experience mainly on software and web industry. Let me start of with Singapore having a pushy, very pushy culture towards work. The first month I started work with a small company I was then so called "given the opportunity" to finish the project during the weekends. I'm not against working on weekends but this was handled in a very creepy way. Looking at being humanely sane, letting a new designer or developer work in weekends is a bad sign.

This is not only about my experience but most friends I came to talk about their experiences seems consistent:

- Unreasonable way of handling projects
- Countless hours need to be clocked to meet a deadline
- Major project changes without changing the deadline

Any factors that may relate to any of them should be immediately be addressed. Addressing these and WLB is still attainable? Yes it is.

For WLB to be attained I believe you can do some preparation which I do not have before I started work here. 

__Speak your mind.__ Instead of saying "Ok" only, asking "Why" which would open up a discussion would actually benefit you in the long run. Having a concrete direction on what to do is one of the most important thing to avoid stress.

__The Power of No.__ At every aspect of work, anyone should be entitled the skill of saying No. The more you do less things, the more you can be efficient. Attain focus and be less distracted. This is not an easy thing because you may need to debate and come up with a win-win solution.

__Proactive.__ Instead of being acted, act on them first. Instead of waiting for your manager to ask you to do things, ask your manager first if there is anything you may help on.

__Move on.__ In the early stages of work, identify any duplicity a boss/manager may have. That itself is a sign to move on immediately. Moving on to another team or company early is more beneficial than ruining your life and career.

__Diversity.__ I'm a foreigner from a third world country. What I experienced above may well be related to why I felt unfair treatment. Having a principle of knowing what you are doing and what you need to do would clear these boundaries.

I would agree to [Philip Su's answer to which company has the best (and the worst) work life balance for employees](https://www.quora.com/Technology-Companies/Among-Microsoft-Google-Amazon-Facebook-which-company-has-the-best-and-the-worst-work-life-balance-for-employees/answer/Philip-Su?srid=T0P&share=1). WLB on any company in Singapore or any country would actually depend on the team you may join in.

Currently, in the company that I'm working with. I am quite glad they do treat people as human beings who have family, friends, and social lives.
