This post was mainly a response to [Why filipino startups fail in the Philippines](http://kareerkoblog.azurewebsites.net/why-startups-fail-in-the-philippines/). As I was writing and reviewing the whole thing, my focus then turned to my experiences which I concluded that we as Filipino developers fail.

## Work

This section was supposed to be about the Philippine Government. At first thought, Philippines has a steady reputation of bad governance. Look at me now, I’m here in Singapore, working for Singapore, and paying taxes to Singapore government. Awesome!

I know, I know, I cannot blame the ph government regarding this issue. But instead of working in my own country, why am I working in abroad? Let me answer that for you.

Financial stability and be able to work at day time.

I was not able to sustain myself in Philippines while I’m working with outsourcing jobs which I need to be awake from 11:00 PM to 8:00 AM. My body turned weaker and weaker day by day after 6 months. It went to a point that I felt so sick that I need to stop, get a proper day job, and be healthier than ever.

I also realized that what I was doing in my outsourcing jobs are ultimately not a good way to develop a career in software or web development. In general, these jobs are mediocre.

## Education

I became a professor after I graduate in my school. Well my school is not at the same level as University of Cebu but you can already understand why education failed in the first place. Because schools hire fresh graduates with no shit experience in the field.

I even remember a scenario where a group of student proposed a paper where they can "detect sections of a website by hovering over the layout which will also highlight the html code related to it". Sounds familiar? Yes they are proposing a Firebug clone. Eventually this paper was ridiculously approved because the panel do not even know that an app like Firebug already exist!

<br/>

## Maturity

After working with outsourcing jobs for two years I really thought of myself as “better than the rest”. After working two years here in Singapore I felt the lack of experience in comparison to Singaporeans, Malaysians, and Europeans. Below were some extremes I experienced which raises everyone in the Philippines as immature.

<br/>

### 1. Communication

I came in Singapore knowing how to “kind of converse in English”. I felt good talking in English in some way. But in reality I cannot converse to anyone, I was even having problems greeting anyone good morning. My mind was still stuck in Bisaya (my native language) then translate those to English. Which is really terrible, when talking I subconsciously pause and say “Ahhhhhmmmm” or repeatedly utter some incorrect words.

<br/>

### 2. Opinions and Self-Defense

My opinions are quite hard or even harsh most of the time. I always try my best for people to submit to it. We all want that right? But without any experience in having debates on which opinions is better, how can one have principle and self-defense? Most of us do not even have principles that we stand-on. Maybe that is one factor we are terrible at agreeing to disagree.

<br/>

### 3. Community

Lets be honest, the IT community in Philippines is crowded with “you're so cool”, “you're so awesome”, “you're doing a good job”. No one even bother to constructively critic another person’s work. In another level, people join groups just to mingle and not really to do some real work. We got no direction on what to do or even accomplish. Might as well sing some

## Success and Failure

I’m really not interested in talking about this in any angle. Well you can comment below to enlighten me but please make sure it’s not one line. Why I’m not interested in this? Because we already kept failing. Com’on! There is [Google located in Hydrebad](http://www.google.com.sg/about/careers/locations/hyderabad) and there is no Google Office in Mindanao nuff said.

## Take Away?

I would really agree on Mike on:

> You want to make software, work a company where you can really learn how to make real-world software. Don’t settle for freelancing or working for a web company where you are stuck making php websites.  
> — [Mike Martinez, Why filipino startups fail in the Philippines](http://kareerkoblog.azurewebsites.net/why-startups-fail-in-the-philippines/)

For me PHP websites are fine, I got no issues with Mike saying _"PHP will never be used for real-time, real-world, mission critical software."_ I just do not like the how people respond and write comments about this. Com'on people you cannot be a developer if you only use PHP. Learn whatever you can, build something and show some promise!

In contrast to the whole failure we experience in Philippines. There are much much bigger problems. Problems that are culturally web together. I hope there is a way to decouple parts of the government and make better abstraction on education. But I do not think institutions are like programming at all.
