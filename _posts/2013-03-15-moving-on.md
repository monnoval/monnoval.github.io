title: Moving On
---

It has been two years of no updates from my old blog and portfolio at ragingfx.com, really no updates, just none. I cannot imagine why it happened like this, well its not that terrible, it just a website left without no owner, but still I felt guilty. Maybe I'm just a stressed by work during the two years and need to move on now.

## Change

I actually can blame Twitter for bringing down Posterous this April 30, 2013. But anyway I also needed a platform that is maintainable and I can easily access using my iPhone. So here it is I'm now using SquareSpace. Well this platform is just damn good! I finished my Porfolio after 3 days including compiling my projects for the past two years. I also finished my About page without no coding. This is really what most people need to understand, it's not about what we can do, but it is about what outcome we can accomplish.

## Forward

Now I'm quite happy with the results. Do make sure to browse in the pages in the site!
