It has been a long time cooking up this post. It is more of balancing between the frustration and realities I experienced while working with different "Managers" (in software and web) here in Singapore. I hope this would enlighten developers.

## Why is everyone a Manager?

Well anyone is manager but not literally "Manager", some may use fancy roles, same shit different air freshener. In job sites, you can already tell. There is a lot of: IT Manager, Project Manager, Assistant Manager, User Experience Manager, Web Content Manager, etc.

It is really odd to see organisations full of manager like roles which is equal to "Executive, Developer, Administrator" roles. What is more odd, most of these people holding these roles only knew bits here, bits there, half here and half there. What I mean is that only few are doing real work.

It has been frustrating. Importance of developers is going down hill. Locals who do code are getting lesser and lesser. Foreigners being hired for developer jobs are gaining so much traction. Quality is blindly burdened. Most managers think that developers like minions from Despicable Me. On the other hand developers loved to be treated like minions. Managers ask them to do A, they do A. Later do B, later they do B. Manager would be surprised why C to Z is not yet done? Well a developer general response is "I'm not told". Developers need to be proactive.

People in managing roles mostly oversimplify a developers job. Most of them just asking "How long would you take to finish X?" without the developer having the overall scope of the project. Then this estimate is taken from bottom to top then if it is late blame will go down from top to bottom. The manager will then ask "Why are we late?" on a developer who clocked countless hours just to hit the deadline. I understand that developers need to be proactive but managers need to listen and understand the issues.

I'm not quantifying all managers as bad. But most of the one's that I encountered are really messed up.

1. Some know what they're doing but permeate false humane concepts.
2. Most do not care on whatever they are doing.
3. The rest work consistently but do not add any value to what they do.

I consider the first one as the __RULERS__. Second as the __CHICKENS__ and the last are the __MAINTAINERS__. They have different powers that distinguish each of them.


<br/>

### RULERS

The rulers as a type of manager knows it all, experienced it all, all can be done. There is nothing wrong about being a ruler but it might be tough to work with them.

Rulers represent themselves as know it all because they need everyone under them to believe them. But of course they really do not know it all, that is why they hire others to do the work for them. The problem with most of them is that they lack the ability to listen to the people under them. They have a mindset to neglect any ideas, or solutions from someone under them.

Rulers feels they experienced it all. Fair enough, they have been developers before. They can talk about polymorphism, object oriented, object relational database, etc. But in reality the projects they did before, or even if they code in the current day, does not represent any of the high level concepts they knew. This is quite an irony because what they share to anyone does not show from any of their work.

Rulers always say all can be done. Well in reality all cannot be done. Every feature should be thought and be entitled with time for planning, development and testing. Having a ruler with in-depth knowledge in IT to be so optimistic is implausible.

I view rulers as people who have very low EQ. This means that what they do which makes others miserable does not translate the same way to them. For rulers they would feel it is just to do so.  For the people under them, it is not fair. Rulers won't feel the same way because of the superiority they thought they have.

### CHICKENS

Chickens are the type of manager that do actual management work. They may have experienced development work but grew tired and just moved on a higher paying work in management.

![Yep these are ducks. Anyway I just like this photo]({{ site.baseurl }}public/images/2015-03-05-03.jpg)

Chickens abilities are more on choosing third party software vendors to do the development work. Chickens set deadlines, monitor progress, set requirements, does manual tests, and go home early at 6:00 PM. They do not have powers to inspire and cultivate a software development team. Com'on they go home at 6:00 PM even if it is a tight deadline.

Chickens only care on the end of project. For them the end of the project means salary bonus. The problem with this is quality and maintainability of the project is neglected. Which may affect the project to be not extensible or scalable for future use.

There is nothing to worry about chickens. Still one needs to be prep all the black and white as chickens are good at pushing additional to-dos for the project.

### MAINTAINERS

Maintainers are people that only maintain the software which is already running in the company for decades. These type of managers know the basics like upload, download, copy paste, and FTP. But in their day to day job they are task to only do nothing. We'll let me be more descriptive about this:

- If you email a maintainer, let say this how to do this and that. He would simply forward you to a someone. That is clever, just push to someone because that is not part of your job scope. Teehee.
- Talk to a maintainer about ground work, such as software development and deployment they will just agree or shut off. They do not do work, they just sit down and google their name. Champ!
- Most of the time, maintainers are old people. They are hard to talk to especially if your young (age around 22-30). They see themselves as someone need to be respected and young people can never push them around. Win!

![Maintainers are like pandas except they are not cute. I still prefer pandas!]({{ site.baseurl }}public/images/2015-03-05-04.jpg)

Maintainers are one of the worst managers I worked with. Instead of spending an hour to fix an issue they will spread it to three days without knowing it.

## Summary

__Rulers__ are good at what they do but they are energy drainers. They tend to get energy from battles, debates and challenges.  If your a collaborative type of person, who loves to communicate and work together with a team then do not feed a rulers hunger. They will just keep on energized when they battle and push people while you continue to add up stress and feel down about yourself.

__Chickens__, most of the time are backstabbers. Management role here in Singapore is a mess, if an issue arises, a chicken would then send an email which would be pushed top, left, right and bottom. Emails are equal to who's fault it is. If you're one of the people who can solve the problem you'll be amazed how people fault each other with a minor issue. Why not just solve the issue? And avoid faulting each other.

__Maintainers__ are quite different on the other hand. They tend to do lesser than any manager. Most of the time they do nothing. If there is an issue they do not fix it but just wait for someone to solve it for them. This is just not acceptable. How can someone with no disability and with a 100% working brain won't be able to provide a solution? But rather wait there and stare at the monitor?
