title: Uncertainties in software project management

I have been working with various people in software, web and mobile. I've been into worse from what I can compare from each team I worked with. Some good most bad, well, this is a world of emotion and uncertainties.

I really liked the quote below and this is the main reason I wrote this post

> Some argue that one can manage software production without the ability to program. This belief seems to arise from the mistaken view that software production is a form of manufacturing.

> But manufacturing is the repeated construction of identical objects, while software production is the construction of unique objects, i.e., the entire process is a form of design.

> As such it is closer to the production of a newpaper [sic] — so that a software manager who cannot program is akin to a managing editor who cannot write.

## Tools

Software development tools are meant to assist developers in day to day task. Mostly are IDEs which solves most configurations needed for development, testing and deployment. Others tools may be used for version control such as SVN, Git and Mercurial. There are also diff tools that help developers see the difference in each line of a file or directory.

Emphasising the problem encountered (in a CMS or framework selected) as an excuse of a project delay. Based on my experience was working with a company using DotNetNuke. The system to be created was so simple, even Wordpress with little modification would be able to do the job. Deadline was delayed because the developer is saying that the javascript would not work in DotNetNuke. This reason is absurd because how can DotNetNuke be the single reason for delaying the project?

When a tool does not match the scope of a project then another tool may handle it better. Forcing a tool to be used is an obsession. If a static generator will do the job then the team agrees, why use a CMS?

## Expertise

I worked with a company who explicitly praised themselves for being expert in Microsoft Technologies. All major projects tackled were all handled in a _"Microsoft"_ direction. Other useful tools that run in PHP, Ruby and Python were all rejected because it is not from Microsoft.

It was kind of getting into a religion. The people working in the group surrounded themselves with the technology they know rather than the solutions technology provide.

As things are becoming a religion any applicants for a web developer position and only knew PHP are normally rejected even though the job description welcomes anyone solid and reliable in their fields.

Platform dependence is a major problem. Managers, developers, and designers need to open up and see where the market is heading. This is not about _"going with the trend"_. This is more of keeping up with major breakthroughs.

## Criticisms

A genuine and sincere manager would never condemn a team member. A manager starting to point finger on who is to blame is extreme.

- A good project manager empowers his team members
- A good project manager finds solutions to problems
- A good project manager expects uncertainties  
- A good project manager appreciates people
- A good project manager is calm

It is uncertain when the manager would just switch mood. Being in management any uncertainty should not become a blame to anybody.

## Estimates and Resources

Estimates becomes deadlines. Deadlines adjusted and became new deadlines. Deadlines continue to change. Why make deadlines when in reality they are just estimates?

Timeline and project scope is impossible to create if there is no available resource. Hiring is what is coming. It is not what a team already have. Saying _"Our team would grow, it is just a matter of time"_ is unrealistic. Time is not a factor for growth and it is an absolute uncertainty.
