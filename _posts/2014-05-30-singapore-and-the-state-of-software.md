title: State of Software in Singapore

Three years ago, I was eager to try out the opportunities Singapore had for developers in software and web. I was excited by companies doing web related jobs. It's a new culture and is well paid (in foreigner's perspective). Now, having experienced it for three years, the industry here is not matured yet.

Anyone staying in Singapore who dedicated their career in software and web development would be able to pin point the issues and the problems. It may be wrong practices, high expectations and poor quality. Ultimately, there is a huge problem with culture.


> On an organizational level, organizations need to understand software rather than looking at it as a cost centre which is best out-sourced and off-shored.

> On a management level, management need to empower people and create inspiring places to work rather than the hierarchy and micro-management control that is unfortunately common in Singaporean companies.

> And on the national level, we need to create a national culture wherein people chose a software development career rather than considering it beneath them.

Software itself is so broad and this industry is less than 50 years. More or less depending which country but in Singapore it is surely less than 25 years. Maybe I'm still standing in a young and developing industry here in Asia.

## Managers and Developers

The most odd thing about huge organizations is that they're full of manager roles which is equal to "Executive, Developer, Administrator" roles. What is more odd, most of these people holding these roles only knew bits here, and half there. What I mean is that only few are doing real work.

- Importance of developers in this country is going down hill.
- Locals who do code are getting lesser and lesser.
- Foreigners being hired for developer jobs are gaining so much traction.

### Quality is blindly burdened

__Managers think that developers are like minions from Despicable Me.__ On the other hand developers loved to be treated like minions. Managers ask them to do A, they do A. Later do B, later they do B. Sooner or later the manager would be surprised why C to Z is not yet done? Well a developer's general response is "I'm not told".
Developers need to be proactive.

__People in managing roles oversimplify a developers job.__ Most of them asks "How long would you take to finish X?" without the developer having the overall scope of the project. Then this estimate is taken from bottom to top. If project went late, blame will go down from top to bottom. The manager will then ask "Why are we late?" on a developer who clocked countless hours to hit the deadline.

Developers need to be proactive but managers need to listen and understand the issues.

## Breaking the snowball

On every project, having issues is a norm. But if issues are passed around like a no-stop ping pong and no one tends to own responsibility. This would iterate again in the following days until crunch time would hit. It becomes a snowball rolling, accumulating all that tiny flaky issues. No one can stop a huge snowball, probably it will break and die on its own.

Most of the time at the low of a human experience we realize and look for solutions for it not to happen again. We stop any foreseeable burden we may encounter. This is change. Singapore's culture towards software needs change.

Improvement and change may only be transparent if an intense drift in attitude towards understanding software happens.
