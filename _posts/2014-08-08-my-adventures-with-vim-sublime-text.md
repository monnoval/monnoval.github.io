Vim is never a need to anyone. But making vim as your editor would never be a bad choice. Programming has never been about [typing or editing speed](http://monnoval.github.io/2014/03/17/how-important-is-touch-typing-to-a-programmer/). Programming is about efficiency in solving logical issues. Editing source code has been a huge issue and no other text editor solves them like vim.

In this post I present Sublime Text, the only text editor that made me step away from vim.

<br/>

## Why switch to Sublime Text?

Sublime Text is fast, easy, and it has the best vim mode! This is the only editor that took advantage of vim users by making their transition easy. So why switch? Well, I grew tired of my vimrc. [Here is my old vimrc](https://github.com/monnoval/dotvim/tree/ba75ca90935eca60460439bed40368e2d3a91777)

My old settings was compatible for Windows, Mac and Linux. As I continued to use it daily, added plugins, update settings, etc, in the end it even confused me and I was not able to maintain it at all.

Heavy configuration was not for me anymore. Vim made me frustrated why I'm not getting the features I needed. Why it doesn't work together nicely out-of-the-box? I was really looking for a productive and error free text editing. It came to a point I was searching "Commercial vim" in google and displays no significant result.

I was less productive and really pissed off. I wanted to move on to a better editor. What I needed is a tool that would work out-of-the-box. I immediately tried using Sublime Text and everything I do all worked gracefully. Below are the major reasons that made me stick to it.

<br/>

### Reason 1. Sublime's Package Control

After trying out Sublime Text for a day. I didn't look at other alternatives. The main thing that hooked me is [Sublime's Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/). The package control is darn easy to search, install, and update extensions from inside of Sublime itself.

Here are the major plugins I love

- [Vintage](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/vintage.html) is a vi mode editing package
- [Tortoise](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Tortoise) - Menu entries to execute TortoiseHg
- [Bracket Highlighter](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/BracketHighlighter) - Bracket and tag highlighter

<br/>

### Reason 2. Search and Replace

Sublime's search and replace is crazy fast. Back then I was using Notepad++ to do a full search and replace on files in a folder. After trying sublime's search/replace I forgot about Notepad++. There has been no other text editor that offered this kind of performance.

If you know other editor that could do this, let me know!

<br/>

### Reason 3. VIM Key-bindings

[Vintage](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/vintage.html) is the most flexible vi-mode I encountered. Vi-modes in other editors are just plain __useless__, we'll you could make use of them if you only use the basic VI commands (and it would be like not using vim). Here are other vi-modes I encountered before:

1. [Vrapper](http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/home/) and [Eclim](http://eclim.org/#welcome-to-eclim) - I failed to make either of this two plugins work in Eclipse. Sorry I could just say that eclipse is totally terrible for modern developers. It is heavy and clunky most of the time. Back then me and my team who was working with Android immediately switched to IntelliJ IDEA. Win!
2. [IdeaVim](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim) for IntelliJ IDEA and family - I used this before when I was doing front-end work with Android. It was Ok but nothing configurable. I may use this again if I need to do development with IntelliJ.
3. [Komodo Edit's vim mode](http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/5.1/vikeybind.html) - No, same as others, simply an emulation and cannot have custom keybindings. Duh. But Komodo is nice to use btw.

So for Vintage, it is easy to setup, you'll be ready in no time! Yeah there is even a youtube video for it!

You could also see the custom key-bindings I use in vintage here.

## Reliving VIM

After 6 months of working with Sublime Text I experienced the lack of prowess apart from how I use vim. I would fully admit now that no editor could replace vim.

It may be a sudden jump that I move to Sublime then back to Vim. I have been a proponent of change especially on the tools I use. If a tool is better than the other then we should be open for a better change.

Do not get me wrong, I still use sublime text. And vim is still the best of all. No vim emulation can ever beat the native powers of vim.
