Looking back in my phone, in the calendar app I was surprised the year is nearing end! A click of thought asking myself what have I done this year compared to past years. This year was crazy! I cannot imagine I experienced so many things! Let's start:

## Writing

I was reading [Habits to Undo at Work](http://monnoval.github.io/2014/04/18/habits-to-avoid/) earlier I never thought my writing would remind me the useful things I'm not doing anymore.

Recently I was avoiding having lunch with coworkers because of tight deadlines. It is disgrace and never-mind I'll try my best to pull back having lunch again.

I also remembered to be more thankful to people. It is a bit hard though, a skeptic minded person being thankful is not as easy as saying "Thank you". The thank you itself needed to be more sincere and open heartedly said. I'll try my best again on this. Roar!

## Stock Market

The stock market has kept me excited every now and then. It is truly unpredictable. Even though the uncertainties are huge, it is manageable. Still no money-back guarantee but it certainly a good vehicle for investment.

I did take some tiny profits a month ago, and it was darn fun! It was a tiny profit though, I felt no one other than me would be happy with it. Anyways, it was so fun and now I'm looking for larger profits! I'm a carefree risk taker and do not take my words for it. [Do read the books I read before starting in the stock market](http://monnoval.github.io/2014/08/21/three-books-to-get-you-started-investing/).

## SquareSpace

I'm quite surprised just now with the new version. [SquareSpace Seven](http://www.squarespace.com/seven/). I was thinking of writing something new and the new interface made me write quickly. It felt faster maybe because it became clean.  One look and I already thought how to use it. Fantastic!

I hope this was a sponsored post by SquareSpace but its not. I deeply appreciate the work that has been given in their platform. It does let people be more efficient in content creation. Awesome!

I was in the thought of converting this site into jekyll and I always brush off the task. Looking back this year, SquareSpace did really improve and did help me focus on content. I can now say I'll just continue my subscription here. Teehee!

## New job

3 months ago I started working at Fastbooking. The transition gave me the worst mental stress I ever had. Being a worker in a foreign country has never been easy. Darn hard man!

- Embracing the culture is the key.
- Understanding people is the basics.
- Being open to uncertainties must be expected. This is the fun part!

When I started working at Fastbooking it opened a new world. I was working with developers in France and it is amazing to see how open they are. Open to new technologies and easy to work with. Again it has been a never ending fun for me!

The above are surprises I never expected to be doing. I never planned any of it. Maybe that's why it is fun! Planning is expecting the best and worst case. While welcoming all uncertainties is the fun part, no one can never expect any uncertain circumstances. All we could do is embrace every inch of it.

The best part of this year are the people who did hold on beside me. Unconditional and unending.

Thanks also to you also for reading! You're the best!
