## Modern CSS Architecture and Front-End by Harry Roberts

By far the best chapter of all. Jumps straight directly to the web with its history and current status. The whole chapter focuses understanding the web and how to write better code that would be maintainable and extensible for future use.

I'm sure most of you are not excited by Object-Oriented CSS. Everybody talks about it and writes about it. But in this chapter, in how its written, it is clear, humanely readable and entertaining. Anologies play an important part that really make you undertand the whole concept. It goes deep in organizing your css files, selectors and naming convention.

The most important of all is the part where I learned how to use BEM (Block, element, modifier) methodology. I've read about BEM before and this is the only it did really stick on me. I would really recommend this chapter to anyone doing front-end web developepment work.
