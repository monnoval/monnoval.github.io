## Modern CSS Architecture and Front-End by Harry Roberts

By far the best chapter of all. Jumps straight directly to the web with its history and current status. The whole chapter focuses understanding the web and how to write better code that would be maintainable and extensible for future use.

I'm sure most of you are not excited by Object-Oriented CSS. Everybody talks about it and writes about it. But in this chapter, in how its written, it is clear, humanely readable and entertaining. Anologies play an important part that really make you undertand the whole concept. It goes deep in organizing your css files, selectors and naming convention.

The most important of all is the part where I learned how to use BEM (Block, element, modifier) methodology. I've read about BEM before and this is the only it did really stick on me. I would really recommend this chapter to anyone doing front-end web developepment work.

## Writing Maintainable, Future-Friendly Code by Nicholas C. Zakas

From the title itself, the chapter is well written and gives a strong emphasis on maintainability and extensibility code for future uses. It gave me an impretion of Nicholas saying that he had experienced all the nuances of having no documentation, styleguide, team work, and awareness.

## Chapters skipped

I got bored reading the following chapters

- The Next Steps For Web Typography by Marko DugonjiÄ‡
- Finding and Fixing Mobile Web Rendering Issues by Addy Osmani
- Obscure Back-end Techniques and Terminal Secrets by Paul Tero

While reading them, there is distant move away from topics covered in earlier chapters.

The chapter about _Web Typography_ focused on how to handle fonts, line heights, leading, letter spacing, etc. It even covered operating system do render type. I was lost on where it was headed. I understood the imporance of type in web and deeply delving in the details of type is extreme. Important but there is other chapters much more fun to read.

_"Finding and Fixing Mobile Web Rendering"_ is a how-to on using chrome's developer tools. The problem here is the screenshots from dev tools have already changed so they might have no use at all. I suggest better you better lick your way into chrome dev tools right away. Or you can just watch some videos on youtube to do that.

Worst chapter of all is _"Obscure Back-end Techniques and Terminal Secrets"_. I got respect on the time and effort spent on this chapter but it was really far from what other chapters are talking about. This chapter was focused on anything related to system administration. It does explain the basics, issues, and solutions. Nevertheless all the information highlighted, I would say this is chapter is worth getting bored.
