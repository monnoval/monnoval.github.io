After watching the video [Defcon 18 Pwned By the owner What happens when you steal a hackers computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4oB28ksiIo). I was in awe. Well Zoz' setup is pretty hard core. He got ssh, and vnc running which I hope I'm able to do someday.

## DuckDuckGo

Now all my searches online is using DuckDuckGo search engine. After setting it as default in my computer I never felt the need to go back to using Google search. Well you might think that I'm trying to avoid Google as much as I can, in reality do we really need to use Google search's advanced feature on jow it personalises our search results? I do not think so.

DuckDuckGo is enough. In iOS 8, Apple even added it as an option in Safari. Apple acknowledges privacy in their devices to great lengths. Set links and examples here.......

I did set DuckDuckGo on every device I use. Our personal and work related searches online must be private and anonymous. It is very harmful that someone is looking at what your are interested and quickly turning that into a marketing venue for companies to sell. It felt that privacy to what you are doing is taken advantage.


## Tor Browser

The browser is typically a modified version of the Firefox browser. Download the bundle install and you can use it as your default browser. Which what I did, I felt this is the right way to do so that at leadt any new links I open up hoes thru the Tor network.

In iPhone, there is no official Tor browser yet. Instead there is a lot of options, one is the Onion Browser which normally fine but it lacks tab browsing, it felt weird using a browser that do not have this feature. The solution is to use Red Browser which is a good replacement for the Chrome browser. 

I stopped using Google Chrome and I'm now using the default Safari. This is more of a personal choice to trust more on Apple. 

Using Tor in either mobile or desktop is slow. Most of the time when I'm doing quick searches online I use Safari just to get results immediately. Using Red Browser + Tir would be best but it is awfully slow and takes time before you can start searching online. 

In desktop having Tor as the default browser is fine. It would slower your browsing but it has good trade offs.

## VPN

I purchased a VPN from Private Internet Access. Well for now I only bought a month of subscription. I may well extend it to a year because the service is good so far. They have an awesome support as well, you can have achat in there website anytime you need. 

Currently I used the VPN service on my laptop, desktop and mobile phone. I never had problem using their software in my computers except in my phone. For my phone I needed to use OpenVPN to connect here are the steps to do it 123
