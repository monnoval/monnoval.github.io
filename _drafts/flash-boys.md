How I grabbed this book

When I saw the book in the corner I first checked the reviews in Amazon, quickly skimmed and read them which are mostly positive. Read thru the first few pages. After I was fully convinced the book would be a good read I immediately paid and continued reading in the coffee shop.

The most exciting book I have ever read. I never stopped reading from page to page
