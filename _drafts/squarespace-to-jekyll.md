title: Squarespace to Jekyll

![]({{ site.baseurl }}public/images/2015-05-07-01.jpg)

I would say I have became a backup geek after I experienced a number of lost content such as photos, documents, and source code. It is dreadful and really excruciating. This time after I lost what I wrote using Squarespace 7 editor. Time to go back writing offline, now using Jekyll.

## Squarespace

I have used Squarespace since I bought the domain name of this website which was two years ago. Sqaurespace is a good platform I really had fun of using it. It was simple and very easy to manage content on every angle. During those times using it I never imagined on switching to fancy plain text.

Before moving all my content to Jekyll I did ask Squarespace support if they are able to retrieve the content I lost. They were eager to help (I kinda felt this way because of the email conversations I had with them). In the end, I had no response from them. Maybe they tried but were unable to retrieve anything.

Working with online tools while having a crappy internet connection increases the possibility of content loss. I depended too much on these tools handling the content I'm working on. Most of these tools, not just Squarespace' alone, is not 100% dependable, you would still need to work offline then transfer it later before publishing offline. A huge dismay for me.

## Moving the Jekyll

It was not easy. Other developers moved from wordpress to Jekyll and had the same problems. I only had 18 posts during the migration and I just did everything manually. Spent like a day to migrate each, setup of Jekyll, moving to github pages, and point the domain to github's IP.

I was quite happy overall:

- [Lanyon, a Jekyll theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) looks alike my old website. Saved me a lot of time!
- I was able to retain the URL structure. So no need to redirect anything.
- Excerpt on the listing of all posts was possible.
- Images for each post are in one place. Just need to name them properly.

## Writing offline

I felt home maybe because of the following

1. I'm using vim to write in markdown, create drafts, and move files. Using vim's keys made writing easier. I am able to jump from one location to another. Switching views has never been so easy.
2. Offline is freakin fast! Well I know offline is like going back to basics and experiencing it back again is extremely gratifying.
3. Committing to git while I'm slowly progressing in my writing felt like I'm working with html/css code. I felt that my progress is safe and won't be gone.

I love markdown. It's simple, no more of opening and closing tags like what we do in html. I love working with plain text, I am able to focus on the content more than ever.

## Simplicity

Overall I just like the way I write content offline. How I wish I were doing offline since the beginning. Well I need to experience losing content first using online editors just to return back to writing offline.
